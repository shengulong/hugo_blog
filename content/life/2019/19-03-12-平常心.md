## 一切都很准时

    New York is 3 hours ahead of California


But it does not make California slow

Someone graduated at the age of 22

but waited 5 years before securing a good job

Someone become a CEO at 25

and died at 50

while another become a CEO at 50

and lived to 90 years

Someone is still single 

while someone else got married

Obama retires at 55

but Trump starts at 70

Absolutely everyone in this world works based on their Time Zone

People around you might seem to go ahead of you

some might seem to be behind you 

But everyone is running their own race in their own time

Don't envy them or mock them

They are in their time zone and you are in yours

Life is about waiting for the right moment to act

so relax 

you're not late 

you're not early

you are very much on time and in your time zone destiny set up for you
